currentCommitHintTitle=Hint Current Commit
currentCommitHint=In the current commit, only tests will be executed, where the trace has been detected to be potentially changed by static test selection. Therefore, in most cases not all tests will be executed.


predecessorCommitHintTitle=Hint Predecessor Commit
predecessorCommitHint=In the predecessing commit (for nightly builds the last execute commit), all testcases are typically executed once. If results are already in the cache, no or less executions of predecessor commits will be done.
